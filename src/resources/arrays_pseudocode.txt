#This programme is for searching first and last index postion from array for target input.

1.Input a target value to find position.
2.Pass target value to searchRange function to find position. //(public static int[] searchRange(int[] nums, int target))
3.Declare array for storing result for starting and end position for target.(Initialize the array with {-1,-1}).
4.Start first For loop to find starting position for the target from start of array.
  	4.1 If you find the target store index postion of target in first postion of result array.
5.Start second For loop which starts from end of array to start of array to find last position of target.
	5.1 If you find the target store index postion of target in first postion of result array.
6.Print final result for starting and ending index postion for the target input.
